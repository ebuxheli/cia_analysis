# Replication of Partners in Crime: An Empirical Evaluation of the CIA Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation Program.

This repositiory holds my replication of Averell Schmidt and Kathryn Sikkink article and analysis on "Partners in Crime: An Empirical Evaluation of the CIA Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation Program", https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592717004224.

The original article has been stored in this repository, but can also be found [here](https://www-cambridge-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/040CA83C6EAEEF856CC0B90BF6606096/S1537592717004224a.pdf/partners_in_crime_an_empirical_evaluation_of_the_cia_rendition_detention_and_interrogation_program.pdf) with the proper Harvard affiliate credentials. The data for the replication of this article can be found on the [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CC8VFT).

Currently, I have been able to replicate all of the replicable plots and tables in the code which are Figure 1-3 and Table 1-3. They still need some modifications to make them look nicer and be better suited for the pdf in which they were placed. This update is impending. A presentation has been made for this dataset.
